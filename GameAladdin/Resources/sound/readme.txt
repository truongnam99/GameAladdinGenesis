Aladdin (MegaDrive)

Ripped by: birdmanager6

Version: 6/15/2018

This is a complete re-rip of the game. I already did a sound effects rip of the game previously a few years ago, but I felt like I needed to redo most of my old rips since I wasn't satisfied with them, so...here's my first one of these.
Also, this version fixes many issues that the previous version did, as well as includes sound effects from the newly-surfaced prototype version of the game dumped back in August '16. For the sound effects using both FM or PSG and DAC, I have provided versions of the sound effects with both the DAC and FM or PSG, as well as each separately. Two things to note about the sounds from this version:
 - Apple Collect, Apple Slice, and Gem Collect are known as Pickup 1, Pickup 2, and Pickup 3 in the prototype.
 - The Made You Look sound effect is broken. It seems to be a (4-bit PCM?) sample saying "Made you look!" probably used at the end of the game over sequence (the genie says this in a word balloon in the final game). It sounds corrupted in the sound test, even more than the actual sample does. This sample was likewise removed from the final version.

Giving credit would be recommended, but isn't necessary.
